For Propositional Logic, implement tautology checking using Analytic Tableaux in SML.

Please adhere to the following datatype for propositions.

datatype Prop =  ATOM of string | NOT of Prop | AND of Prop * Prop | OR of Prop * Prop | IMP of Prop * Prop


Given a set Γ, the expectation is to give a tableaux proof of its validity. If not, it must output the Hintikka set corresponding to any open path.

There are many heuristics which can be applied to shorten the tableaux proof. For example, 

1) Applying all elongation rules before branching.

2) When both ψ and ψ ∨ φ are present in Γ, then branching on ψ ∨ φ is redundant.

You are free to come up with your own additional heuristics. But you must document the correctness argument for the heuristics applied, along with illustrative examples. 

The Grading will be relative to the most efficient implementation among the submissions.
